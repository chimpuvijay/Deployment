# CRUD-springboot-mysql-redis-rabbitmq

This is a modern spring boot CRUD application that has a fully functional & secured user management system and it uses rabbitmq for event-driven updates, redis for caching and mysql as a database. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build and run the application you need : 

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

### Running the app locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.app.crud.DemoApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
